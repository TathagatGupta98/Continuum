/**
 * Trade-position backfill script — reconstructs Position rows from on-chain
 * TradeExecuted logs, without restarting the API server.
 *
 * Usage:  pnpm db:backfill
 *
 * Why this exists: trade positions are only persisted by the live chain watcher
 * (watchContractEvent sees future events only). Any trade that landed while the
 * backend was down — or before the DB was wiped/re-seeded — is missing from the
 * portfolio until reconstructed. LP positions are unaffected because they are
 * read live on-chain. This script runs the same idempotent, absolute-write
 * backfill the watcher runs at startup, for every market in the DB.
 *
 * Run `pnpm db:seed` first if the Market table is empty — markets must exist
 * before their trade logs can be attributed.
